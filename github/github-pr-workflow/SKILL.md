# GitHub Pull Request Workflow

Complete guide for managing the PR lifecycle. Each section shows the `gh` way first, then the `git` + `curl` fallback for machines without `gh`.

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated with GitHub (see `github-auth` skill)
- Inside a git repository with a GitHub remote

### Quick Auth Detection

```bash
# Determine which method to use throughout this workflow
if command -v gh &>/dev/null && gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
  AUTH="gh"
else
  AUTH="git"
  # Ensure we have a token for API calls
  if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
    if [ -f ~/.hermes/.env ] && grep -q "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" ~/.hermes/.env; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" ~/.hermes/.env | head -1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '\n\r')
    elif grep -q "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null; then
      GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's|https://[^:]*:\([^@]*\)@.*|\1|')
    fi
  fi
fi
echo "Using: $AUTH"
```

### Extracting Owner/Repo from the Git Remote

Many `curl` commands need `owner/repo`. Extract it from the git remote:

```bash
# Works for both HTTPS and SSH remote URLs
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
OWNER_REPO=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]||; s|\.git$||')
OWNER=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$OWNER_REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)
echo "Owner: $OWNER, Repo: $REPO"
```

---

## 1. Branch Creation

This part is pure `git` — identical either way:

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date
git fetch origin
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feat/add-user-authentication
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feat/description` — new features
- `fix/description` — bug fixes
- `refactor/description` — code restructuring
- `docs/description` — documentation
- `ci/description` — CI/CD changes

## 2. Making Commits

Use the agent's file tools (`write_file`, `patch`) to make changes, then commit:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/auth.py src/models/user.py tests/test_auth.py

# Commit with a conventional commit message
git commit -m "feat: add JWT-based user authentication

- Add login/register endpoints
- Add User model with password hashing
- Add auth middleware for protected routes
- Add unit tests for auth flow"
```

Commit message format (Conventional Commits):
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`

## 3. Pushing and Creating a PR

### Push the Branch (same either way)

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Create the PR

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add JWT-based user authentication" \
  --body "## Summary
- Adds login and register API endpoints
- JWT token generation and validation

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass

Closes #42"
```

Options: `--draft`, `--reviewer user1,user2`, `--label "enhancement"`, `--base develop`

**With git + curl:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls \
  -d "{
    \"title\": \"feat: add JWT-based user authentication\",
    \"body\": \"## Summary\nAdds login and register API endpoints.\n\nCloses #42\",
    \"head\": \"$BRANCH\",
    \"base\": \"main\"
  }"
```

The response JSON includes the PR `number` — save it for later commands.

To create as a draft, add `"draft": true` to the JSON body.

## 4. Monitoring CI Status

### Check CI Status

**With gh:**

```bash
# One-shot check
gh pr checks

# Watch until all checks finish (polls every 10s)
gh pr checks --watch
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
# Get the latest commit SHA on the current branch
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Query the combined status
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/status \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f\"Overall: {data['state']}\")
for s in data.get('statuses', []):
    print(f\"  {s['context']}: {s['state']} - {s.get('description', '')}\")"

# Also check GitHub Actions check runs (separate endpoint)
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/check-runs \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for cr in data.get('check_runs', []):
    print(f\"  {cr['name']}: {cr['status']} / {cr['conclusion'] or 'pending'}\")"
```

### Poll Until Complete (git + curl)

```bash
# Simple polling loop — check every 30 seconds, up to 10 minutes
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  STATUS=$(curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/status \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['state'])")
  echo "Check $i: $STATUS"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "success" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "failure" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 30
done
```

## 5. Auto-Fixing CI Failures

When CI fails, diagnose and fix. This loop works with either auth method.

### Step 1: Get Failure Details

**With gh:**

```bash
# List recent workflow runs on this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5

# View failed logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# List workflow runs on this branch
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runs?branch=$BRANCH&per_page=5" \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
runs = json.load(sys.stdin)['workflow_runs']
for r in runs:
    print(f\"Run {r['id']}: {r['name']} - {r['conclusion'] or r['status']}\")"

# Get failed job logs (download as zip, extract, read)
RUN_ID=<run_id>
curl -s -L \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/logs \
  -o /tmp/ci-logs.zip
cd /tmp && unzip -o ci-logs.zip -d ci-logs && cat ci-logs/*.txt
```

### Step 2: Fix and Push

After identifying the issue, use file tools (`patch`, `write_file`) to fix it:

```bash
git add <fixed_files>
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI failure in <check_name>"
git push
```

### Step 3: Verify

Re-check CI status using the commands from Section 4 above.

### Auto-Fix Loop Pattern

When asked to auto-fix CI, follow this loop:

1. Check CI status → identify failures
2. Read failure logs → understand the error
3. Use `read_file` + `patch`/`write_file` → fix the code
4. `git add . && git commit -m "fix: ..." && git push`
5. Wait for CI → re-check status
6. Repeat if still failing (up to 3 attempts, then ask the user)

## 6. Merging

**With gh:**

```bash
# Squash merge + delete branch (cleanest for feature branches)
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Enable auto-merge (merges when all checks pass)
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
PR_NUMBER=<number>

# Merge the PR via API (squash)
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/merge \
  -d "{
    \"merge_method\": \"squash\",
    \"commit_title\": \"feat: add user authentication (#$PR_NUMBER)\"
  }"

# Delete the remote branch after merge
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git push origin --delete $BRANCH

# Switch back to main locally
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git branch -d $BRANCH
```

### Merge methods (generic): `"merge"` (merge commit), `"squash"`, `"rebase"`

### Project-Specific Deployment Protocol

**Never assume a project's branch topology or deployment rules.** Projects vary: `develop` → `staging` → `main`, `develop` → `staging` → `canary` → `main`, GitHub Flow, trunk-based, etc. Branch names, auto-deploy behavior, and approval requirements differ.

Before any merge or push:
1. **Read the project's memory/context files** (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `.hermes/project.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`). Look specifically for:
   - Branch → environment topology.
   - Hard rules on merges — many projects require **explicit per-turn user approval** for production (`canary`/`main`) pushes. Approval does **not** carry over between turns.
   - Whether direct push or PR is required for each branch.
   - Auto-deploy behavior (Railway, Vercel, etc.).
2. **If the project context does not specify rules**, ask the user before pushing to any branch that could trigger a deployment or affect teammates.

### Pitfall: Committing on the wrong branch when user says "push to X"

When a user says "commit and push to staging" (or any non-current branch), **switch to the target branch BEFORE committing**. Do not commit on the current branch and cherry-pick — that contaminates the source branch with a commit that was never approved there.

**Wrong (what happened):**
```bash
# Currently on main, user says "commit and push to staging"
git add . && git commit -m "..."   # ← committed on main!
git checkout staging
git cherry-pick <sha>              # ← too late, main already has the commit
```

**Right:**
```bash
# Currently on main, user says "commit and push to staging"
git checkout staging               # ← switch FIRST
git add . && git commit -m "..."   # ← commit lands on staging
git push origin staging
```

This matters especially when the current branch is `main`/production — even an unpushed local commit on `main` violates "never push to main without explicit approval" in projects with strict branch flow (`development → staging → main`). The commit exists in the local git history and must be reset.

**Recovery if you already committed on the wrong branch:**
```bash
git checkout <wrong-branch>
git reset --hard <previous-sha>     # undo the commit on the wrong branch
git checkout <target-branch>
git cherry-pick <sha>               # apply only to the target
git push origin <target-branch>
```

### Pitfall: Merge overwriting uncommitted working-tree changes

When you have uncommitted edits in your working tree and then run `git merge` (e.g., merging `staging` → `main`), the merge can silently overwrite your uncommitted changes if the incoming branch has a different version of the same file. Git's merge strategy resolves the file to the incoming version, and your local edits are lost — with no conflict warning because the working-tree version wasn't committed.

**What happened (real example):** Fixed `paymentDate` → `batch.createdAt` in `dashboard/route.ts` on `main` (uncommitted). Then ran `git merge --no-ff staging` to bring in a prior fix. Staging's version of `dashboard/route.ts` still had `paymentDate`, so the merge overwrote the uncommitted `createdAt` fix. The file looked clean after the merge, but the fix was gone.

**Prevention:** Always commit or stash working-tree changes BEFORE running any merge. If you have edits that need to survive a merge:
```bash
git add <file> && git commit -m "fix: ..."   # commit first
git merge --no-ff <branch>                    # then merge
# If the merge reverts your commit, cherry-pick it back:
git cherry-pick <your-commit-sha>
```

**Detection after the fact:** If you suspect a merge overwrote your fix, grep the file for the key change:
```bash
grep -n "createdAt.*monthStart\|paymentDate.*monthStart" src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts
```
If you see the old pattern instead of your fix, the merge reverted it. Re-apply the patch and commit.

### Pitfall: `git stash` across branches

Avoid `git stash` + `git checkout <branch>` + `git stash pop` when you have untracked files or branch-divergent directories. `stash pop` can create `add/add` merge conflicts if:
- The target branch already contains files with the same names (even if untracked in your working tree).
- The tracked files you stashed have diverged between branches.

**Prefer:** if the changes are focused (e.g., new feature files), use `git add` selectively, checkout the target branch, and `git commit`. If you must stash, be ready to `git merge --abort` and retry cleanly.

### Resolving merge conflicts during branch switch

When a merge hits conflicts:
1. Inspect conflicted files: `git status --short | grep -E "^UU|^AA|^DD"`
2. For simple ours/theirs conflicts: `git checkout --ours <file>` or `git checkout --theirs <file>`
3. Stage and continue: `git add <file> && git merge --continue`
4. If unrecoverable: `git merge --abort` (or `git rebase --abort`) and try cherry-picking individual commits.

### Enable Auto-Merge (curl)

```bash
# Auto-merge requires the repo to have it enabled in settings.
# This uses the GraphQL API since REST doesn't support auto-merge.
PR_NODE_ID=$(curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['node_id'])")

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/graphql \
  -d "{\"query\": \"mutation { enablePullRequestAutoMerge(input: {pullRequestId: \\\"$PR_NODE_ID\\\", mergeMethod: SQUASH}) { clientMutationId } }\"}"
```

## 7. Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start from clean main
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Branch
git checkout -b fix/login-redirect-bug

# 3. (Agent makes code changes with file tools)

# 4. Commit
git add src/auth/login.py tests/test_login.py
git commit -m "fix: correct redirect URL after login

Preserves the ?next= parameter instead of always redirecting to /dashboard."

# 5. Push
git push -u origin HEAD

# 6. Create PR (picks gh or curl based on what's available)
# ... (see Section 3)

# 7. Monitor CI (see Section 4)

# 8. Merge when green (see Section 6)
```
